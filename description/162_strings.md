## Strings

ThePrimeagen dice que go string handling is mid, rust is amazing.

Two literals:

- `'c'` for characters
- `"string"` for strings

Una lista string, se debería poder "ver" como una lista de chars o una lista de bytes. Un char puede ser de múltiples bytes (UTF8)

```
my_string(5)            -- The fifth character
my_string | bytes_get(&_, 4)  -- The fourth byte
```


Declaration:

```
my_str := "this is a string declaration"

my_str := """
	this is a multi-line string declaration
	Openning line is ignored
	The closing quotes serve as the reference for indentation.
	"""

```



Several escape sequences are supported:

- `\"` - double quote
- `\\` - backslash
- `\f` - form feed
- `\n` - newline
- `\r` - carriage return
- `\t` - tab
- `\u{xxxxxx}` - unicode codepoint


## Implementation

Strings should follow the same ownership split as lists:

- `String` is the owning type.
- it should be backed by `Allocation`.
- string views should stay borrowed and non-owning.

One reasonable base direction is:

```
String : Type = (
    .allocation : Allocation
    .length     : UIntNative
)

StringViewRO : Type = (
    .string : &String
    .start  : UIntNative
    .length : UIntNative
)

StringViewRW : Type = (
    .string : $&String
    .start  : UIntNative
    .length : UIntNative
)
```

Copying a string view should copy only the descriptor. It should never imply
ownership of the underlying bytes.

Current implementation direction:

- `String` is now an owning byte buffer over `Allocation`.
- `init(.p = $&string, .length = n)` allocates exactly `n` bytes.
- `deinit(.self = $&string)` releases the backing allocation.
- `String` itself is not directly indexable for now.
- byte-level access is explicit:
  - `bytes_get(.string = &string, .index = i)`
  - `bytes_set(.string = $&string, .index = i, .value = b)`
- borrowed `StringViewRO/RW` types still make sense as the longer-term shape for
  explicit windows into a string, but byte indexing should not live directly on
  `String`.

This is intentionally narrower than the long-term text model. UTF-8-aware
character indexing and higher-level string construction can be layered on top
later, but the base owner/view split should already be real and usable.

The more advanced concerns, such as UTF-8 indexing helpers, cached rune
offsets, or specialized dynamic-string growth strategies, can be layered on top
later.
