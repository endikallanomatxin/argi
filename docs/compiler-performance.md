# Measuring compiler frontend performance

Build the compiler and benchmark tool before measuring, with no test suite active:

```sh
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe install build-frontend-benchmark -j16
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe benchmark-frontend -- MODULE 12 1
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe benchmark-frontend -- MODULE 12 8
```

The optional arguments after the module select iteration and frontend worker
counts. The benchmark compares fresh and reused in-memory frontend work and edits;
source collection, LLVM code generation, and native linking are outside its timings.
Use the same sources, target, optimization mode, and machine load when comparing.

CLI builds persist canonical module snapshots in `.argi-cache/frontend/`.
`--no-cache` bypasses this reuse; `--stats` reports reuse. Global semantics, safety,
and code generation still run. Measure complete CLI builds separately from the
in-memory frontend benchmark.

## Frontend workers

`--frontend-jobs auto` uses half the detected logical CPU count, rounded down,
with a minimum of one and a maximum of eight. CPU-query failure selects one.
Explicit counts from 1 to 256 override this policy. CPU detection is not a global
scheduler and does not guarantee detection of CPU quotas.

Only independent module discovery and local semantic lowering use these workers.
Parsing, cache acquisition/publication, global semantics, safety, and codegen stay
serial. Cache hits create no worker task; zero or one dirty module runs serially.
Worker count does not affect cache identity or language behavior.

Use `--frontend-jobs 1` when an outer runner schedules many compiler processes.
Program fixtures and `argi test` already select one frontend worker; dedicated
concurrency tests explicitly override it. Frontend workers and the regression
suite's `-Dtest-jobs` process workers are separate controls.

When changing concurrency, compare graphs, diagnostics, emitted LLVM, and program
results between serial and parallel runs. Include failing modules, cache reuse,
and worker cleanup. See [compiler testing](../CONTRIBUTING.md#compiler-tests).
