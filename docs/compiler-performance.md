# Measuring compiler frontend performance

Build the compiler and benchmark tool before measuring, with no test suite active:

```sh
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe install build-frontend-benchmark -j16
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe benchmark-frontend -- MODULE 12 1
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe benchmark-frontend -- MODULE 12 8
```

The optional arguments after the module select iteration and frontend worker
counts. The benchmark compares fresh and reused in-memory frontend work and edits;
source collection, LLVM code generation, and native linking are outside its timings.
Use the same sources, target, optimization mode, and machine load when comparing.

CLI builds persist canonical module snapshots in `.argi-cache/frontend/`.
`--no-cache` bypasses this reuse; `--stats` reports reuse. Global semantics, safety,
and code generation still run. Measure complete CLI builds separately from the
in-memory frontend benchmark.

## Frontend workers

`--frontend-jobs auto` uses half the detected logical CPU count, rounded down,
with a minimum of one and a maximum of eight. CPU-query failure selects one.
Explicit counts from 1 to 256 override this policy. CPU detection is not a global
scheduler and does not guarantee detection of CPU quotas.

Only independent module discovery and local semantic lowering use these workers.
Parsing, cache acquisition/publication, global semantics, safety, and codegen stay
serial. Cache hits create no worker task; zero or one dirty module runs serially.
Worker count does not affect cache identity or language behavior.

Use `--frontend-jobs 1` when an outer runner schedules many compiler processes.
Program fixtures and `argi test` already select one frontend worker; dedicated
concurrency tests explicitly override it. Frontend workers and the regression
suite's `-Dtest-jobs` process workers are separate controls.

When changing concurrency, compare graphs, diagnostics, emitted LLVM, and program
results between serial and parallel runs. Include failing modules, cache reuse,
and worker cleanup. See [compiler testing](../CONTRIBUTING.md#compiler-tests).

## Incremental resolution profile

Build `zig build build-execution-benchmark -j2` with no active test suite, then run:

```sh
./zig-out/bin/execution-benchmark 1000 minimal calls 1024 --resolution-profile
./zig-out/bin/execution-benchmark 1000 minimal rejections 1024 --resolution-profile
./zig-out/bin/execution-benchmark 100 prelude calls 1024 --resolution-profile
```

The optional `# resolution` rows report cumulative pass calls, outer pool entries
visited, passes returning a change, inclusive milliseconds and fixed-point rounds.
Nested type/effect traversals are not counted as extra pool visits. Timings can
nest: global verification is inside completion, and materialization can recurse.
Do not add inclusive columns to estimate total time. Counters live outside semantic
transactions so rejected/speculative work remains visible. Normal compilation has
no profile collector. Use unprofiled runs for throughput comparisons.

Debug observations on Linux x86-64, based on `develop` `9a2cb9f1` plus this
instrumentation, with a 1,024 MiB tracked allocation limit:

| Session | Commands | Frontend/publication ms | Six pool passes ms | Global verification ms | Pending checkpoint ms |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Minimal / calls | 10 | 43.2 | 0.7 | 0.3 | 0.05 |
| Minimal / calls | 100 | 462.4 | 32.8 | 21.0 | 0.31 |
| Minimal / calls | 1,000 | 23,303.6 | 2,752.0 | 9,447.7 | 3.00 |
| Minimal / rejections | 1,000 | 2,432.9 | 23.7 | 0 | 2.56 |
| Prelude / calls | 100 | 22,850.3 | 3,275.7 | 984.4 | 37.72 |

The six passes cover binding types, assignment values, dereferences, addresses,
generic types and error-reason candidates. The 1,000 accepted minimal calls visit
33,673,566 outer entries across these passes without any of them returning a
change. Their 1,000 checkpoints copy just one pending entry in total; the prelude
case copies 622,201 entries across 100 checkpoints. Queue copying is not the main
cost in either measured workload.

Global verification is a stronger candidate in growing minimal sessions than
these six scans alone. Core/prelude sessions have a different cost distribution:
completion takes 11.38 s, resolution 7.20 s and checking 1.50 s across 100 commands.
These are diagnostic observations, not attribution to individual inner routines.
Profile verification components and remaining completion work before changing
validation boundaries or introducing new caches.
